# Emotion-detection
Real- time Emotion detection with OpenCv, NumPy and Tensorflow

training data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
In my archive train I referring to a numerical scale for emotions (angry - 0, disgust - 1, fear - 2, happy - 3, neutral - 4, sad - 5, surprise - 6)
Overview
This repository contains a real-time emotion detection system using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system leverages machine learning and computer vision technologies to recognize and classify emotions from facial expressions in video streams. The model is built using TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning framework, while OpenCV is used for image processing and real-time video capture.

Features
Real-Time Emotion Detection: Detect and classify emotions from facial images in live video streams.
Emotion Classification: Recognizes seven primary emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
Face Detection: Utilizes Haar Cascade Classifier to identify faces in video frames.
Visualization: Displays the detected emotion on the video feed.
